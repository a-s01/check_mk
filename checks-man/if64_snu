description:
 This check does exactly the samee as {if64} but has some features:
 - using ifName instead ifIndex for interface name
 - not using ifPhysAddress and ifDescr at all
 - and a main feature: you can choose interfaces by ifName (or ifAlias if you set if_inventory_uses_alias to True) pattern among the same ifType. For example monitor only Po interfaces among all interfaces with ifType equals to 53.

{Note} Before using this check you must patch the if.include file in checks directory with if.include.v1.2.4.patch (tested only for v1.2.4)

[configuration]
The same as {if64} has but with one new variable:
if64_snu_porttypes_filter (dictionary): Here you can specify what you want to filter. Syntax is 'ifType': ("tuple with name patterns"). Dictionary key must be a string value (means use quotes). ifType must be present in {if_inventory_porttypes}. Default is
if64_snu_porttypes_filter = {
    '53': ('^Po','^Ag','^vcp'),
 }
